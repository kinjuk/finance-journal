## A Market-Based Critique of the UN Rapporteur’s Statement on Housing

The Special Rapporteur’s report raises valid human rights concerns but excessively frames housing through a highly ideological lens that risks dismissing essential economic principals and basal realities. It emphasizes state intervention and regulation over incentives, participation, and innovation. While it’s crucial to address homelessness and affordability, this must be done in a way that encourages rather than punishing investment, participation, and economic activity. The focus on the wealthy's accumulation of housing assets, while politically charged, risks reducing a complex economic issue to a narrative that justifies heavy-handed regulatory interventions. This framing may cater more to ideological motives than to constructive policy development that respects individual liberty and economic freedom. 

The report overlooks the basic principles of supply and demand. If regulations or market constraints make affordable housing financially unviable, developers will naturally gravitate toward luxury segments where margins are sustainable. This also means that as less affordable housing is available in one area, people will relocate to more affordable regions, which, in turn, helps rebalance the market and better equips it to handle future challenges. It is plainly evident that a low-income household cannot reasonably expect to live in a beachfront property; the same principles apply to certain urban centers. Blaming financial actors while ignoring these market dynamics provides an incomplete diagnosis. 

Rather than resorting to price controls or excessive intervention which distort the free market, policy efforts should focus on enabling a healthier housing market through the reduction of bureaucratic red tape, permitting delays, and regulatory fees. This creates conditions for increased housing supply across all segments.  

Restricting real estate investment under the pretext of curbing speculation undermines economic freedom and investor confidence. A vibrant and participatory market is one where individuals can invest and build wealth. Overregulation risks sending the wrong signal to the international community about the robustness of our markets. 

As a Portuguese citizen, I believe it's important to recognize that not all housing-related hardships stem purely from economic inequality. In some cases, cultural practices and lifestyle choices also influence living conditions. While this does not justify neglect or discrimination, it’s important for policy to distinguish between structural poverty and self-selected communal lifestyles when designing housing strategies. 

Rather than demonizing investment in real estate, we should democratize it. A public REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) framework for Portuguese housing could offer citizens a stake in national development, improve transparency, harness market forces for the public good and all without resorting to coercive regulations. Instead of paying ongoing housing subsidies to low-income families, the government could allocate participatory shares in these public REITs. As the market appreciates, so would the value of their holdings, creating long-term financial inclusion while shifting the burden away from permanent state support and toward a one-time investment in shared prosperity.  

The most effective solution remains the simplest: build more. A significant increase in housing supply whilst being supported by incentives for developers and streamlined approval processes would exert downward pressure on prices organically. Coupled with citizen participation through micro-investments in housing REITs, this can align public and private interests without infringing on economic liberties.
