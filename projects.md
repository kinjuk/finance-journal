## üîÑ On-going

### ‚ñ∏ Momentum Strategy Research (MACD & RSI)  
Exploring momentum-based systems using MACD and RSI crossovers.  
Extending to assets like Gold, Bitcoin, and sector stocks to evaluate where these signals are most effective and where they fail.

### ‚ñ∏ Finance-Journal Organization  
Sorting course notes, key concepts, essays and misc tools.  

### ‚ñ∏ FX Interest Rate Arbitrage Calculator (Excel)  
Tool to compare net yields when switching between currencies (EUR ‚Üí USD) based on central bank rates vs broker conversion costs and current FX rate.  
Calculates whether it's worth converting for yield advantages (as in 2% ECB vs 4% Fed).  
Add spot rate out and spot rate back.  
Add implied 1y forward spot rate (assuming normal market conditions where forward is expected above spot / backwardation scenarios excluded).  

### ‚ñ∏ Beta (Œ≤) Calculator (Excel)  
Spreadsheet tool to calculate a stock‚Äôs beta relative to a benchmark index.
Calculates 3y, 5y, and 10y betas using daily closing price data.

Implementing either Google Finance formulas as direct ticker reference in the sheet or imported CSV files fetched separately via Python (yfinance). "Easy vs Accurate" dilemma. 

Beta is calculated through slope function. A covariance method might be added in paralel to crosscheck the data.

## üóìÔ∏è Scheduled / To Come

### ‚ñ∏ Portfolio Optimization in Excel  
Step-by-step implementation of modern portfolio theory using Excel.  
Includes expected return, standard deviation, covariance matrix, and solver-based optimization.  
Goal: build a reusable template to maximize return vs. risk across various asset combinations.

### ‚ñ∏ Portfolio Efficiency Comparison Tool  
Excel-based tool to evaluate and compare portfolio strategies using Sharpe, Sortino, and other risk-adjusted metrics.  
Identify the most efficient portfolio construction approach across different assets and optimizations.

### ‚ñ∏ Order Types & Trade Flow Note  
Simple write-up with diagrams explaining market, limit, stop, and conditional orders.
